DNSMORPH is a domain name permutation engine in the works. It is being written in [Go](https://golang.org/) to ensure that the end result is a robust, small and fast tool ideal for everyday use.

Please consult the [issues page](https://github.com/errantbot/dnsmorph/issues) to see what's in the roadmap to v.1.0.0 and how the project is progressing.
