DNSMORPH is a domain name permutation engine, broadly inspired by [dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist). It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) making for a small and fast tool ideal for everyday use. It robustly handles any domain or subdomain supplied and provides a number of configuration options to tune permutation attacks. 

![demo](https://github.com/netevert/dnsmorph/blob/master/docs/demo.gif)

DNSMORPH includes the following domain permutation attacks:
- Homograph attack (both on single and duplicate characters)
- Bitsquat attack
- Hyphenation attack
- Omission attack
- Repetition attack
- Replacement attack
- Subdomain attack
- Transposition attack
- Vowel swap attack
- Addition attack
