DNSMORPH is a domain name permutation engine, inspired by [dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist). It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) making for a compact and **very** fast tool. It robustly handles any domain or subdomain supplied and provides a number of configuration options to tune permutation runs. 

![demo](https://github.com/netevert/dnsmorph/blob/master/docs/demo.gif)

DNSMORPH includes the following domain permutation attack types:
- Homograph attack (both on single and duplicate characters)
- Bitsquat attack
- Hyphenation attack
- Omission attack
- Repetition attack
- Replacement attack
- Subdomain attack
- Transposition attack
- Vowel swap attack
- Addition attack

Installation
============
There are two ways to install dnsmorph on your system:

1. Downloading the pre-compiled binaries for your platform from the [latest release page](https://github.com/netevert/dnsmorph/releases) and extracting in a directory of your choosing.

2. Downloading and compiling the source code yourself by running the following commands:

    - ```go get -v github.com/netevert/dnsmorph```
    - `cd /$GOPATH/src/github.com/netevert/dnsmorph`
    - `go get -v ./...`
    - `go build`

An Arch Linux package is also [available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dnsmorph/).
